# Discord Bot - Custom Replies and Slash Commands

This Discord bot, built using `discord.js`, responds to custom text messages and handles multiple slash commands. The bot can be extended with additional functionality, allowing for interactive features in your Discord server.

## Features

- **Custom Text Replies**: The bot replies to specific user messages with pre-defined responses.
- **Slash Commands**: Supports slash commands like `/ping`, `/test`, and `/test2`.
- **Interaction Handling**: Listens for user interactions and responds accordingly.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.6.0 or higher)
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) (v14.x)
- A Discord bot token

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install discord.js
   ```

3. Set up a `.env` file in the project root to store your Discord bot token securely:
   ```
   TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   ```

## Usage

1. **Add custom message replies**:
   Modify the `messageCreate` event in the code to add custom replies. For example:
   ```js
   if (message.content === 'hello') {
       message.reply('Hi there!');
   }
   ```

2. **Running the bot**:
   After setting up the bot token and configuring your responses, start the bot:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Commands

### Custom Message Replies
The bot listens to the following message and replies:
- **"hey"**: Replies with `chala ja`
- Any other message: Replies with `This is a message for you`

### Slash Commands
The bot responds to the following slash commands:
- `/ping`: Replies with `Pong!`
- `/test`: Replies with `This bot is under maintenance.`
- `/test2`: Replies with `This www is under maintenance.`

## Adding Slash Commands

You can register additional slash commands by modifying the command registration process. Example of adding a command:

```js
const commands = [
  {
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Replies with Pong!',
  },
  {
      name: 'test',
      description: 'Test command registration!',
  },
  {
      name: 'test2',
      description: 'Another test command.',
  },
];
```

Ensure to deploy these commands using Discord's API by following their [slash command guide](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/slash-commands.html).
